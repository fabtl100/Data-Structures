# Data Structures class programs
This repository contains the programs that I developed during my Data Structures class back in 2017 in UABC's Faculty of Science. These are just some of the programs that I did in the class, the rest of them were lost in my old computer. These I could recover because they were saved in my Google Drive.

## algorithmcomparison.cpp
This program is part of a laboratory assignment. The goal was to compare sorting and searching algorithms in time of execution and number of comparisons. The sorting algorithms used are: Bubblesort, Selectionsort, Insertionsort, Quicksort and Randomized Quicksort. The searching algorithm are: Linear search and Binary search.
