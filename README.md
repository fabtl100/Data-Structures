# Data Structures class programs
This repository contains the programs that I developed during my Data Structures class back in 2017 in UABC's Faculty of Science. These are just some of the programs that I did in the class, the rest of them were lost in my old computer. These I could recover because they were saved in my Google Drive.

## algorithmcomparison.cpp
This program is part of a laboratory assignment. The goal was to compare sorting and searching algorithms in time of execution and number of comparisons. The sorting algorithms used are: Bubblesort, Selectionsort, Insertionsort, Quicksort and Randomized Quicksort. The searching algorithms are: Linear search and Binary search.

## matchthreegame.cpp
This program is one of the mini-projects from the course. It is a tile matching game with a board of numbers. The goal of the game is to move the numbers to make matches of 3 or more of the same number. The game finishes when there are no more movements available to make matches. The board is displayed in the console in a square matrix of numbers, the user will be asked to enter the <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> coordinates of the two elements that the user wants to swap to try to make match. This was the first mini-project and it uses arrays only to store the board.
